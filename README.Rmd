## Overview

geographr is an R package for mapping UK geographies:  

- `boundaries_*` objects distribute boundaries (as [simple feature](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) objects)
- `points_*` objects distribute point geometries (as [simple feature](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) objects)
- `lookup_*` objects provide a set of lookup tables
- `ruc_*` objects provide a set of rural-urban classifications
- `calculate_*` functions solve common aggregation problems

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("humaniverse/geographr")
```

## Development

To add data sets to the package:

1. Update `data-raw/query-urls.R`. Keep to alphabetical ordering.
Make sure to build and export the tibble.
2. Add a file to `data-raw/`. See other files for template.*
3. Document the data set in `R/data.R`. Keep to alphabetical ordering.
4. Run `devtools::document()` to export documentation.
5. Run `devtools::check()` to check for errors/warnings/notes.
6. Update `LICENSE` by adding the license of the new data set if not already
covered.

\* To reduce dataset file size, simplify polygons before exporting the dataset
with `rmapshaper::ms_simplify()`, setting the `keep` argument to the lowest 
possible value before rows begin to drop out of the data frame.

## UK geographies guide

### Census

#### OA
Census output areas (OA) are the smallest unit for which census data are 
published - they were initially generated to support publication of 2001 
Census outputs and contain at least 40 households and 100 persons, the target 
size being 125 households. They were built up from postcode blocks after the 
census data were available, with the intention of standardising population 
sizes, geographical shape and social homogeneity (in terms of dwelling types 
and housing tenure). 

#### SOAs
Super Output Areas (SOAs) are a set of geographical areas developed following 
the 2001 census, initially to facilitate the calculation of the Indices of 
Deprivation 2004. The aim was to produce a set of areas of consistent size,
 whose boundaries would not change (unlike electoral wards). They are an 
 aggregation of adjacent Output Areas with similar social characteristics. 
 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) typically contain 4 to 6 OAs with a 
 population of around 1500. Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) on average 
 have a population of 7,200.

### Administrative

#### Electoral Wards
Electoral wards/divisions are the key building blocks of UK administrative 
geography. They are the spatial units used to elect local government councillors
 in metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts, unitary authorities and the 
 London boroughs in England; unitary authorities in Wales; council areas in 
 Scotland; and district council areas in Northern Ireland.

#### Local Authority Districts
English local authority districts (LAD) (both metropolitan and 
non-metropolitan), London boroughs and unitary authorities average around 23 
electoral wards/divisions each, Northern Irish district council areas around 
22, Scottish council areas around 11 and Welsh unitary authorities about 40. 
Population counts can vary substantially, even within a single LAD, but the 
national average is about 5,500. LA's are split by Lower Tier Local Authorities 
(LTLA's) and Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA's). The difference between the 
two being LTLA's use district councils and UTLA's use county councils. The ONS 
refers to LTLA's as LAD's, and UTLA's as Counties and Unitary Authorities.

### Health

#### Integrated Care Systems

Originally coined sustainability and transformation plan (STP), then accountable
care systems in 2017, they were renamed in February 2018 to 
[Integrated Care Systems](https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/integrated-care-systems/) (ICS). 
They cover the whole of England and form part of the 
[NHS Long Term Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Long_Term_Plan). In an 
ICS, NHS organisations, in partnership with local councils and others, take 
collective responsibility for managing resources, delivering NHS care, and 
improving the health of the population they serve. ICS are supposed to be bring
together NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups and local authorities.

As part of the 2022 Health and Care Act, ICSs were formalised as legal entities
into Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and Integrated Care Partnernships (ICPs). See
[here](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/upcoming-code-changes/implementation-of-icbs-from-april-2022)
and [here](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/integrated-care-systems-explained)
for more information. ICBs retain the old ICS codes.

#### Clnical Comission Groups

Replacement for PCT’s. They work with patients and healthcare
professionals and in partnership with local communities and local
authorities. The aim of this is to give GPs and other clinicians the
power to influence commissioning decisions for their patients. CCGs are
groups of general practices (GPs) which come together in each area to
commission the best services for their patients and population. CCGs are
responsible for about 60% of the NHS budget, they commission most
secondary care services. CCGs were decommisioned in July 2022 as part of the 
2022 Health and Care Act. Sub Integrated Care Board Locations (SICBLs) have
taken their place, retaining their codes.

#### Primary Care Networks

Introduce in January 2019. They provide the opportunity for GP practices
to join networks, each with between 30,000 and 50,000 patients. The
stated aim is to create fully integrated community-based health
services. Most networks are geographically based and, between them,
cover all practices within a clinical commissioning group (CCG)
boundary. There are some exceptions where there were already
well-functioning networks that are not entirely geographically based.
Some networks cross CCG boundaries.

#### NHS Trusts

An NHS trust is an organisational unit within the National Health
Service in England and Wales, generally serving either a geographical
area or a specialised function (such as an ambulance service). As of
April 2020 there are altogether 217 trusts.

#### Primary Care Trusts

Primary care trusts (PCTs) were part of the National Health Service in
England from 2001 to 2013. They were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part
of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, with their work taken over by
clinical commissioning groups.

#### Health Boards
*Scotland*: Delivery of frontline healthcare services in Scotland are the responsibility
of 14 regional National Health Service (NHS) Boards that report to the Scottish
Government. Current boundaries of NHS Health Boards in Scotland are defined by
National Health Service (Variation of Areas of Health Boards) (Scotland) Order
2013 (SSI 2013/347), which came into force on April 1st 2014, and replaces the
previous definition based upon the former Regions and Districts of the Local
Government (Scotland) Act 1973. This change was made in order to re-align
Health Boards with the combined area of each Local Authority that they serve.
Subsequent changes to Local Authorities will result in corresponding amendments
to Health Board boundaries in order to maintain alignment.

*Wales*: In 2003 Wales established 22 health boards that were coterminous with
their 22 local authority areas. This has since been reformed to seven areas
following the One Wales Strategy/Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act
2014. These new health boards have mixed coterminosity with local authority
areas.

### Postal

#### Postcodes
Postcodes are alphanumeric references comprising an outward code of 2–4
characters and an inward code of three characters.
